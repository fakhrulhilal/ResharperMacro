It takes 3 parameter:

1. The first parameter is the referenced variable
2. The second parameter is the word that will be replaced. We can use [Regex.Replace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.regularexpressions.regex.replace). Whenever invalid regex specified, then it will give a value from first parameter instead.
3. The third parameter is replacement word. It also accept regex replacement, just like second parameter. We can also leave it empty for removing purpose.
